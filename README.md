# Kwanpa
A smart health monitoring app
## About Kwanpa
Kwanpa is a smart health management system that enables users to track, manage, and improve their daily lifestyle habits. The system integrates with existing IoT-based health platforms, such as the Apple Health app or smart watch, to automatically collect real-time data including steps, sleep patterns, calories, and other vital health metrics. 

By combining this data with user-inputted lifestyle routines, the app generates personalized reminders, interactive health dashboards, and progress insights in a user-friendly manner. These insights are accessible not only to the user but also through a simplified dashboard for the userâ€™s caregiver(s) and doctors, allowing them to monitor wellbeing and provide timely interventions - ultimately reducing emergency and referral cases in the long run.
